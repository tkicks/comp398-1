<H1>Welcome to my website!</H1>

<p>Here you will find an excruciating lack of attention to detail, features and design functionality starting with this writer's uncertainty of how the word "excruciating" is spelled.</p>

<p>Earlier I dropped a piece of macaroni on the floor and it's still there.</p>

<p><strong>Yadda yadda something about me</strong></p>

<H3>For now here is a picture of me, but who knows it might be of a giraffe later</H3>

<p>You're still here? Uhh go to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.liss.7" target="_blank"> <strong>Facebook</strong></a> page I guess, not sure why you'd want to though.</p>
