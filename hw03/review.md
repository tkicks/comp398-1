Styleguide Evaluation:

1) Comments:  Lots of comments, very helpful as this is a pretty well rounded program with lots of features.  I liked the amount but some of the PRE/POST sections could have been a bit more concise.

2) Source Code:  Easy to read, used very clear variable names that made sense in context.  Some abbreviations were used, while style sheet says to avoid them, but they were pretty clear and easy to understand so it's not a problem.  Whitespace was used in a good manner, spaced the code out just enough so that it's not clumped together.

3) Structure:  As mentioned above, good whitespace and comment usage

4) Complexity:   This program is a very robust one.  Lots of features (mainly five different types of searching) make it rather complex, yet it was written in such a way that it's easy to understand, read and learn.

Code Evaluation:

1) Unchecked Parameters:  Mostly everything seems to have been given an "else", meaning that anything that's not a specific input will return a statement about an incorrect input being used.  One thing that I don't like about it is that it notifies the user about the error, then shuts down, whereas it would be much better if the user was notified that they entered a bad input and then are given a chance to retry.

2) Design: As mentioned above, the design of the program is very nice and it's way better looking and performing than anything I've done!

3) Final thoughts and Issues:  At the very beginning Y/N prompt, a lowercase "n" will return the "i did not understand so I'll assume Y" message.  

If you enter the name "Undercover Boss" in the name search, it will notify the user of an error, redisplay the options for searching and prompt the user to enter another name.  After that it goes right into another "sorry I don't understand" message and quits.   The last line looks like this: "Please enter the code for the search method you would like to use: Sorry I don't understand your input."  Press any key to continue . . .

If you enter the name "Middle", it will tell you that the program is not found and successfully go to another search options page.

Other inputs do similar things.  Clearly the search function needs a bit of work, but the other search functions do their intended jobs perfectly.

Overall it's a very well written program and I was very impressed with it.  

10/10 would break again
