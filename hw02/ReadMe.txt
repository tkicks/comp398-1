In class LL (linked list):

	-addLine  creates a new node and adds the line that it's given from the database to its own info section. Then it moves the pointer to the next node.
	
	-getText  this grabs the text stored in the info section of the node and returns it so that it can be printed to the screen.


	-main  open output.txt -> use addLine on each line of text -> uses a for-loop to print out the contents of all the nodes.
